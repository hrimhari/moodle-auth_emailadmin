Hi Moodle Admin,

A new account has been requested at \'{$a->sitename}\' with  the following data:

Any specific user field example:
user->lastname: {$a->lastname}

All custom fields:
{$a->customfields}

All user fields + custom fields:
{$a->userdata}

To confirm the new account, please go to this web address:

{$a->link}

In most mail programs, this should appear as a blue link which you can just click on.  If that doesn\'t work, then cut and paste the address into the address line at the top of your web browser window.

You can also confirm accounts from within Moodle by going to
Site Administration -> Users
